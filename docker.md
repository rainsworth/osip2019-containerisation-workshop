## Summary
Containerisation is a method of bundling an application or pipeline with all its dependencies, from language runtimes like Python and R to the operating system itself. This technology has already revolutionised web development by providing a simple way to run web applications a in precisely controlled environment, regardless of which computer system they are running on. This workshop will explain how these advantages can be easily applied to bioinformatics analysis, to ensure 100% reproducibility of your work, along with easy distribution of your pipelines to other users without the need for complex installation.

This workshop will teach you:

* What containerisation is, and why you might use it in bioinformatics
* What some common containerisation tools are, and when to use each of them
* How to find and run containers built by other people
* How to run containers on HPC systems (like Melbourne Bioinformatics)
* How to build your own application into a container (containerisation)
* How to use containers as elements of a bioinformatics pipeline

## Requirements

* This workshop is aimed at anyone with basic Unix command-line experience
* Attendees are required to bring their own laptop computers
* Windows users should have [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) installed
